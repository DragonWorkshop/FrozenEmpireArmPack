# Q pack MK2.1
Open-source version of the proton pack from Ghostbusters.

You can find the premade STL as well as the opensource .step file.
Our goal is to make the best easy to use 3D printable version of the proton pack from ghostbusters and ghostbusters 2.
you can use the full project or parts of it.
I took the time and effort to make almost everything needed to build one. (shell, legris , banjos, clippards, brackets, ...)


they are made for 3D printing, so some little modifications are expected but it should be a pretty good representation of the Proton pack.


List of options include: different hero pack variations ( Venkman and Spengler ) as well as stunt version.


TO DO: Documentation for assembly and variations listing.
        Detailed plans.
