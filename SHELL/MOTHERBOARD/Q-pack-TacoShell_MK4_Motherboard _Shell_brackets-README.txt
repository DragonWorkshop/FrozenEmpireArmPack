POST PRINTING WORK REQUIRED- DO NOT USE AS IS!!!!!
PRINT @ 100% infill
You will require a drill to adapt these to use.

I do not advise using these especially without M5 or larger threaded inserts or backing nuts. Because everyone will have varied access to suitable hardware I provide these brackets as a starting point with pilot holes to be used as templates to make metal brackets. I use M5 for the bracket to motherboard and M6 for shell to bracket. 

If you insist on using printed brackets do so at your own risk. 

PRINT AT 100% infill
Decide if you are using backing nuts or threaded inserts. 
Drill shallow hole into the backside of the bracket that your threaded insert or backing nut can fit into. 
Install threaded insert/Secure backing nut
Drill the rest of the hole to a size to match your bolt size. This should be a smaller diameter hole than your threaded insert. (See picture)
