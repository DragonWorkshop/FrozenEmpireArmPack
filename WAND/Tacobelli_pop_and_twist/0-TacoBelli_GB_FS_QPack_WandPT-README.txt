Download all files. 
The files are numbered.
Parts noted ALL are required for all versions and should be printed at 100% infill.
You do not need to print all of the parts listed. 
Print one of each number and at each duplicate number choose the variation for your build. Meaning if there are three 01-pop latch files, choose the one best suited for your build according to the file name. 
Parts are noted for the PVC, Printed, or Metal variations. 
Additionally some parts have versions based on your preference. 
The red parts (if photos are present) are printed with 100% infill, the rest is at 15% .15mm layer height.

Minimum Required Materials:
M3x25-30mm screw (barrel to main #1 screw/spring attachment/pop guide)
M3x6-10mm screw (Barrel to main #2 screw/pop guide)
M3x10-25mm screw (latch set screw)
M3x6-10mm screw (latch spring screw)
M3 Nuts, Washers and or spacers. 
1/8" OD steel or brass rod (pop lever)
MISC springs or rubber bands (qty 2 to 4) from a hardware store.
20mm-22mm OD clear acrylic tube about 140mm long (inner diameter can vary, I used 20/16mm OD/ID and later upgraded to the GBFans tube and metal hybrid option)
You'll need to cut the clear tube to your preference. Far too many variations for me to adapt. I tried to at least allow for the larger tube sold by GBFans(22.5x140mm). 136mm seems to work well and is the length I've been using. 
*Metal parts specific materials listed at the end.*

If you have the ability it is recommended to thread the holes using a tap. 

The most tricky part of the build is attaching the main spring. It will attach inside the barrel to main tube part using the longer of the two barrel screws. 
Either screw can be used in either position of the barrel to main tube. One screw is at 12 o clock, the other at 9 o clock (facing the body).  
The pop rod can be flipped left or right. 
The pop rod has a slot in the side of it. One screw should pass through the slot and the other should help keep the rod from twisting inside the barrel. 
I use the long screw at the 12 o clock position, hook the spring around it, and then fully screw it in until it presses on the opposite side of the main tube. This keeps the spring from fallong off. The only problem is you will most likely need to remove the Clippard Valve to access this screw to remove the main tube. 
The 9 o clock position screw (short screw) only has to slightly pass through the slot in the pop tube. This screw limits travel of the pop and also keeps the rod from twisting.  
Depending on your washers, spacers, and barrel thickness the two screws may need to vary slightly in length.

Pop tube basic cutting guidance:
Mark off 140mm on the pop tube. 
Mark off 1/2 of the tube lenghtwise.You will have an "rectangular" area that is approx 140x15mm that you will need to remove. ensure that you do not cut this incorrectly. See the pictures for guidance. I will attempt to make a template but it is too large for most printers at over 200mm.
