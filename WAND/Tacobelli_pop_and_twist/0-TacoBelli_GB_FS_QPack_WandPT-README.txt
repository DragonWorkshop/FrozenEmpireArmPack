The files are numbered.
Parts noted ALL are required for all versions and should be printed at 100% infill.
You do not need to print all of the parts listed. 
Print one of each number and at each duplicate number choose the variation for your build. Meaning if there are three 01-pop latch files, choose the one best suited for your build according to the file name. 
Parts are noted for the PVC, Printed, or Metal variations. 
Additionally some parts have versions based on your preference. 
The red parts (if photos are present) are printed with 100% infill, the rest is at 15% .15mm layer height.

Pop tube basic cutting guidance:
Mark off 140mm on the pop tube. 
Mark off 1/2 of the tube lenghtwise.You will have an "rectangular" area that is approx 140x15mm that you will need to remove. ensure that you do not cut this incorrectly. See the pictures for guidance. I will attempt to make a template but it is too large for most printers at over 200mm.
